## Dataset

We used a [kaggle Spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) which consists of over 160k songs dating back to 1920.

## Design Decisions
First and foremost, we performed exploratory data analysis to explore different variables from the dataset. From this, we found that the large number of variables would make it hard to visualize all of the data at once. We chose selective visualizations that can focus in on a subset of the data. The dual-page style visualization helps us with this. On the first page, we have bubble graphs. We chose bubble graphs because popularity is a relative value, which can be depicted with circle sizes for easy user understanding and comparison.

On the artists page, we thought it would be most useful to see songs in relation to each of the artists. A lollipop chart was best to show a timeline of songs. Bar charts are a great way to depict all of the different song attributes, and even resemble music volume bars.

We chose to exclude certain data that was inconsistent, such as the genre of each artist. However, this definitely also excluded some potentially interesting information from our visualization.

Overall, having the embedded graphs that can be reached through clicks helps lead users through the different components of the visualization. The interactivity that allows users to vary year, the number of top artists and songs, and the number of songs on the artists page, allows for more user engagement.
